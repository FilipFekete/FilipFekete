# Hi there, I'm Filip Fekete üëã

[cite_start]I'm a **Software Engineering Student** currently in my final years at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU)[cite: 3, 11, 14]. [cite_start]I'm passionate about full-stack development, embedded systems, and using my technical skills to build intelligent, user-friendly solutions[cite: 59, 62].

## üí° A Note on My Activity

Don't let the visual commit history fool you! My most significant contributions and commits are usually gathered around the time when projects require the most critical work. I focus on delivering quality and getting the work done when it really matters. Plus, I don't post every single piece of code I write to GitHub üòâ.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Skills

Here are some of the technologies and tools I work with:

| Category | Technologies & Tools |

| **DevOps/Other** | [cite_start]Git, **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**, Agile [cite: 22, 23, 28] |

[cite_start]In addition to my technical stack, I bring strong **teamwork, communication, and adaptability** to any project[cite: 30, 31].

## üöÄ Latest Projects

I enjoy taking on challenging projects that apply both software and hardware knowledge. Here are my three latest highlights:

### 1. AI Resume Analyzer - Web App
* [cite_start]**Description:** Developed an **AI-powered web application** for resume analysis, providing structured and intelligent feedback[cite: 59]. [cite_start]It features a simple, responsive UI built with **React (Vite)**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**[cite: 60].
* [cite_start]**Key Feature:** Integrated **Puter** for secure storage and user authentication services[cite: 61].
* **Repository Link:** [Link to AI Resume Analyzer Repository]

### 2. Electronic Nose - Embedded Smell Detection System
* [cite_start]**Description:** A collaborative project on an **ML-powered embedded system** for smell detection and classification using gas sensors[cite: 62, 63]. [cite_start]I applied **Agile** methods and integrated hardware with Python software[cite: 65].
* [cite_start]**Key Feature:** Established a **CI workflow (GitHub Actions)** for automated quality checks and managed ML data collection/standardization[cite: 64].
* **Repository Link:** [Link to Electronic Nose Repository]

### 3. Web Designer at a Publishing Company (Past Experience Highlight)
* [cite_start]**Description:** While working at raabe.sk, I focused on creating visually appealing layouts and translating ideas into user-friendly designs[cite: 52, 53, 54, 55]. [cite_start]This experience strengthened my foundational **HTML and CSS** skills, as well as problem-solving in UX[cite: 54, 56].
